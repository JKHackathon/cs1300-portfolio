      The alert banners in both Reddit and Spotify were very useful as they very
      clearly displayed that an action had been complete. While this feature was
      lacking in EdStem, the presence of a bright yellow star at least provided
      enough indication of the post being saved. I personally found the ability
      to immediate undo saves very useful, however, this likely will not apply
      to my application as I intend to have each item have a button that saves
      and unsaves. Filtering within saved posts in EdStem is a bit lacking, as
      only certain filters may be used, which has made finding specific posts
      more difficult in my experience.
