  <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>

  <p>
    The purpose of this project was to learn to identify usability and
    accessibility problems in a webpage and to produce an improved website,
    redesigned to be responsive.

  <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

  <p>
    This blog article is not responsive at all, like many other older scientific
    blogs. It is a cute little website, but it has not been updated since 2015
    and is lacking in many ways. The choice of font is legible but strangely,
    the readability is still not great. The overall learnability of the website
    is good as its components follows typical website conventions. For the most
    part, navigating and interpreting the functionality of the webpage is
    straightforwards. Overall, this webpage feels old due to the structure and
    design choices in which groupings are formed.

  <p>
    On the accessibility side, this website is rather lacking. Several images
    are missing alternative text, though they do have captions, but they often
    are not detailed enough for the purpose of screenreaders. Furthermore, there
    are several empty headings, no page regions, and many repeated links which
    makes navigation more difficult for users with screenreaders.
